## :whale2: Introduction

**Orca** is a **general-purpose** Roblox script hub designed to make convenient tasks **easy** and **satisfying**.

Use many different **action cards** on the [**Home**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#house-home) and [**Apps**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#iphone-apps) page, or check out what we have featured on the [**Scripts**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#newspaper-scripts) page.

Press `K` to open or close Orca. For the best experience, a 1080p monitor or above is recommended!

## :rocket: Quick start
